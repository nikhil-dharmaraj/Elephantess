# Elephantess
Elephantess is an iOS app that raises awareness for wildlife conservation and allows users to foster orphan elephants, all through DSWT. It was created as a submission entry for Los Altos Hacks 2018, and the DevPost submission link is posted here: https://devpost.com/software/elephantess-hxi6be.

The app spreads activism for the cause of elephant protection; it gives users a way to foster an orphaned elephant living at DSWT from their mobile app and provides useful infographics that highlight the crux of our poaching plight. Through it all, the main goal is to simply give a voice to these living creatures, robbed of their parents by humans and therefore deserving great aid from humans. Elephantess uses PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController along with Apple Pay & Stripe.
